**This Lab was undertaken to demonstrate the implementation of a reusable**  
**barrier class**  
**This barrier class will act as a rendezvous for any amount of threads**
**which can be defined by the user through changing the number in the source.**
**Running the 'make DOC' command in the terminal will produce an executable file,**
**and all the documentation associated with it.**
**this file can then be run with the following:  ./ReuseBarrier**
**The project name and output directory can be changed using the declarations**  **in the Makefile**
