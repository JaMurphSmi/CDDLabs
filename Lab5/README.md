**CDDLabs Labs for my fourth year Concurrent and Distributed Devices module**  
**This Lab was undertaken to demonstrate the implementation of the**  
**Producer/Consumer problem where one thread creates data, and one consumes.**
**Running the 'make DOC' command in the terminal will produce an executable file,**  **and all documentation associated with it** 
**this file can then be run with the following:  ./ProduceConsume**
**Project name and output directory can be changed using declarations in Makefile**
